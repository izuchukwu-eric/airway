In July 2015, Warburg Pincus had agreed to invest $133 million in Ecom Express.<br \/><br \/>&#8220;In India, 70% of the e-commerce market is mobile and electronics. If you look at markets worldwide, categories like apparel, home decor, grocery, furniture form a larger share in a mature market. We believe these categories will grow in India, accelerating the need for third-party logistics players. The horizontal players will continue to be the largest players while categories like grocery and furniture will see the emergence of vertical players,&#8221; said Neeraj Bharadwaj, managing director at Carlyle Group, India.<br \/><br \/>He added that the group decided to invest in the company based on the scale, technology and its data sciences and analytics capabilities.<br \/>Delhivery which began as hyperlocal food delivery startup in Gurugram soon pivoted to became an e-commerce logistics company, ridding piggyback on the online retail boom. It currently services 600 cities and 8500 pin codes through its logistics network. The company also has a network of 12 fulfilment centres and works with companies like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/topic\/Flipkart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Flipkart<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/topic\/Paytm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Paytm<\/a>. For the financial year ending March 2016, the losses of Delhivery were at Rs 317 crore as compared to Rs 71 crore in FY 2014-15 as sourced by data research platform Tofler while the revenues grew to Rs 495 crore during the same period over Rs 228 crore in the previous year, FY 2015-16.<br \/><br \/>The company had previously raised $85 million from Tiger Global,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/topic\/Nexus-Venture-Partners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nexus Venture Partners<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/topic\/Multiples-Alternate-Asset-Management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Multiples Alternate Asset Management<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/topic\/Times-Internet-Ltd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Times Internet Ltd<\/a>\u00a0in May 2015. Multiples Alternate Asset Management later sold part of its stake to Tiger Global.<br \/><br \/>ET in its edition dated February 28 was the first to report about Carlyle closing in on the investment.<br \/><br \/>Delhivery founded in 2011 has gone on record to say that the company is on the path to profitability in an interview given to ET in October. &#8220;We are profitable and it will reflect in our results for fiscal 2018,&#8221; said Sahil Barua, co-founder of the company.<br \/><br \/>According to experts tracking the sector, close to 1.4 to 1.5 million packages from e-commerce companies are processed daily in India.<br \/><br \/>&#8220;This is a fraction of the China delivery market where close to 75-80 million packages are shipped daily. As an investor in ANE Technologies, we will share our learning in express deliveries and LTL (less than load, implying small freight) with the company,&#8221; added Bharadwaj.<br \/><br \/>While Goods and Services Tax will see a consolidation of warehouses and the transport sector, it will be a good opportunity for Delhivery to increase scale, said Bharadwaj. &#8220;I don&amp;t think acquisition is necessary to build scale. As GST comes along and there is consolidation in the market, we as a larger player will absorb some of the business,&#8221; said Bharadwaj.<br \/><br \/>Previously Delhivery had invested in last mile food delivery company\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/topic\/Opinio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Opinio<\/a>\u00a0which was acquired by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/topic\/Curefit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Curefit<\/a>\u00a0earlier this year as well as first-mile pickup service provider\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/topic\/Parcelled\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Parcelled<\/a>\u00a0which rolled back operations.<br \/><br \/>Technology-enabled logistics businesses are expected to emerge as the next big market, growing from $1.4 billion in 2015 to $9.6 billion by 2020, according to a report by investment bank\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/topic\/Avendus-Capital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Avendus Capital<\/a>.<br \/><br \/>CAP under Bharadwaj has also become a proactive PE investor having backed Metropolis, PNB Housing Finance, Medanta, in the last 3 years. As of December 31, 2016, the group has invested approximately $1.4 billion of equity in more than 30 transactions in India across all funds. According to industry sources, it has invested the highest amount in 2015 in a single year since setting up its India operations in 2000.<br \/><br \/>Founded in 1987 in Washington, DC, Carlyle \u2013 the world&amp;s 2nd largest PE fund &#8212; manages $183 billion worth of assets, according to its website. Roughly one-third of those assets are managed by its private-equity team.<br \/><br \/>Last year, the firm had ranked India as the most attractive investment destination in the whole world, offering the highest expected returns on incremental capital over the next 4 years.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/small-biz\/money\/100-million-delhivery-from-carlyle-as-e-commerce-logistics-hots-up\/articleshow\/57802614.cms<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":9615,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[18],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v17.7 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>$100 million Delhivery from Carlyle as e-commerce logistics hots up<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Carlyle&amp;s investment in Delhivery will be among the largest PE investment in the space.
