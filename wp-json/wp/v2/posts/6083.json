Before the pandemic, this would have been unthinkable. Today, the convenience and controllability of ecommerce has accelerated its growth. Especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).<\/p><p>Cash on delivery is a preferred mode of payment and constitutes 65% of orders booked online. Cancellation due to delayed delivery is a logistic nightmare as it leads to reverse logistics and increased cost. Today your online business is as strong as your logistics. Partnering with one of the best courier partner for ecommerce is the key to success.<\/p><p>The impact of ecommerce on SMEs in India has changed the landscape. Ecommerce adoption is growing rapidly in tier 2 and 3 cities. Small businesses are making niche products and selling through their own storefront (website\/WhatsApp store\/Facebook store etc.) as well as through large marketplaces. This is opening up opportunities across the board.<\/p><p>However, while orders are coming in, aggressive lockdowns have disrupted supply chains, making it harder to fulfil them. As even some of the largest ecommerce players are struggling, it can only be tougher for SMEs. Small businesses are especially struggling to:<\/p><ul><li>Ship products on time<\/li><li>Predict delivery timelines<\/li><li>Prevent returns and refunds due to lockdown-related restrictions<\/li><\/ul><p>What if every small and medium enterprise could have the power of a responsive ecommerce logistics strategy that multi-national online players have? Well, now you can.<\/p><p>It\u2019s a far-fetched dream in India due to the size and varied geography. To ensure accurate, safe, and on-time deliveries, you would need a network of warehouses, trucking terminals, transport fleet, and expertise and knowledge to do it right every time.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-adb7a10 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"adb7a10\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">WHAT IS A RESPONSIVE ECOMMERCE LOGISTICS STRATEGY?\n\n<\/h2>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-daaf442 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"daaf442\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Responsive ecommerce logistics companies are alert to the changes in the market, resilient in the face of disruptions and adaptive to stakeholder needs.

There are multiple levels of problems you can face in fulfilling this order. Some of them are:<\/p><p><b>Inability to transport:<\/b>\u00a0There might be lockdowns in certain states, where you can\u2019t even get the product through the borders. Without knowing the details in advance, you might ship a product that can\u2019t be transported, incurring both real and opportunity costs.<\/p><p><b>Inability to deliver:<\/b>\u00a0Your customers might be from localities which are marked as containment zones, where you can\u2019t deliver the product. By shipping such orders, you will be wasting time and inventory.<\/p><p><b>Inability to communicate:<\/b>\u00a0Without knowing in advance whether a product can be shipped\/delivered, you can\u2019t let the customer know either. A customer might place the order, wait for 8-10 days only to realise they\u2019re not getting the product after all. This will cause dissatisfaction among your customers, who might never give you another chance.<\/p><p><b>Inability to re-sell:<\/b>\u00a0When a product can\u2019t be delivered, it\u2019s often stored in the local fulfilment centre, without being swiftly returned to you. As a result, you can\u2019t re-sell or re-purpose such products either.<\/p><p>Without a responsive logistics strategy, you can lose not just revenue, but also reputation and long-term customer loyalty, despite having exceptional products!<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-a2e3e6d elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"a2e3e6d\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">WITH A RESPONSIVE ECOMMERCE LOGISTICS STRATEGY\n<\/h3>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-13e1fca elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"13e1fca\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A responsive ecommerce logistics strategy prevents all these problems even before they occur.

You can also retain the product in your own warehouse, which you can ship to another customer whose locality is not under lockdown.<\/p><p><b>Timely cancellations and refunds:<\/b>\u00a0Situations are changing every day. Governments are announcing lockdowns at short notice. This is causing large scale disruptions on ecommerce fulfilment services. But by tracking lockdown\/containment data, you can offer cancellations and refunds to orders placed from localities that later became containment zones.<\/p><p>Let\u2019s say a customer places an order on Monday and the government announces a complete lockdown on Tuesday. You can proactively reach out to your customer and let them know that the order can\u2019t be fulfilled and process their refund. This way, you\u2019ll allow the customer to make alternative arrangements as soon as possible.<\/p><p>As you can see, the advantages of a responsive logistics strategy are many.
