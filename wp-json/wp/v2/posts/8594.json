It is a tremendous honour to be recognised by a jury of one&#8217;s betters. Delhivery was started with a simple idea \u2014 to make logistics in India more efficient,\u201d said Sahil Barua, its cofounder and chief executive.<\/p><p>Delhivery started life as a hyperlocal food-delivery startup, ferrying food from restaurants to customers, several of whom happened to be e-commerce entrepreneurs. Enthused by the quick service \u2014 it would deliver in 30 minutes \u2014 customers asked it to also deliver their companie&#8217;s products. The company moved from local food delivery to e-commerce fulfilment, because it spotted an opportunity to create an integrated, technology-driven solution for what would become a multibillion-dollar market.<\/p><p>After having spotted the potential of e-commerce delivery and tapping the market, the company started facing saturation of demand, as e-tailers like Flipkart and Amazon strengthened their own logistics and moved the business in-house. This was when Delhivery showed its nimbleness and began expanding to cover all pieces of the supply chain. The eight-year-old firm diversified into areas such as cross-border, business-to-business logistics and integrated distribution solutions to enterprises.<\/p><p>\u201cWe believe that the next global integrator must emerge out of India, and that for India to reach its economic aspirations of becoming a $5 trillion economy, a sea change in logistics is inevitable. We will continue to invest aggressively in building our logistics infrastructure and technology platforms and growing our team as we have done since 2011, when we began our journey,&#8221; Barua said.<\/p><p>Today, Delhivery processes more than 500,000 parcels a day and is valued at over $1.5 billion. It provides a full suite of logistics services, including express parcel transportation, freight, reverse logistics, and B2C warehousing and technology services. It raised funding from SoftBank Vision Fund in February this year, catapulting it into the unicorn league.<\/p><p>\u201cThere was a compelling need in India for a company like Delhivery given the serious impact of the logistics sector on the country\u2019s GDP. Also, logistics is relevant for a lot of industries like engineering goods, fashion, auto, logistics\u2026,\u201d said Renuka Ramnath, the founder and MD of Multiples Alternative Asset Management and a jury member.<\/p><p>Ramnath and Satyan Gajwani, vice-chairman of Times Internet, recused themselves from the vote, given their standing as existing investors in Delhivery. Times Internet is part of the Times of India Group that also publishes The Economic Times.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><\/div><div class=\"social-icons clearfix\">\u00a0<\/div><\/div>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/startups\/et-startup-awards-2019-delhivery-wins-startup-of-the-year\/articleshow\/70322313.cms<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":8596,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[18],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v17.7 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>ET Start-up Awards 2019 - Delhivery Has Upended the Highly Fragmented Logistics Industry - Delhivery<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Delhivery has posted the news about the ET Startup Awards 2019 - Delhivery has upended the highly-fragmented logistics industry.
