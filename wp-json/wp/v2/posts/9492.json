Consider the e-commerce industry, or any industry where goods are delivered to an address. In absence of proper geocodes, most companies in India, \u201csort\u201d the packages or goods by pincode, since pincode is the only numeric location depictor that appears in most written addresses in India.<\/p><p>While this sounds like a logical solution, e.g., to have deliveries sorted by pin codes and even creating facilities (that store the shipments for delivery or return) according to the demand volumes those exist in respective pin codes. However, two major, practical problems arise while implementing this idea:<\/p><ul dir=\"ltr\"><li>About 30-40% [2] of the pin codes in India are written incorrectly, leading to shipments being misrouted and requiring manual intervention for eventual routing to the correct pincode<\/li><li>The average area a pincode covers 179 sq. km. with about 135,000 households and over 100,000 business, educational institutions, government buildings etc. Sorting deliverables for more than a quarter million addresses, where only 30% of those addresses are structured, poses many challenges<\/li><li>We will pick an area within the Logistics and Transportation industry to illustrate the challenge in detail. Consider an e-commerce, which is growing at a 30 CAGR\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloombergquint.com\/markets\/2017\/09\/28\/morgan-stanley-bets-on-digital-to-forecast-6-trillion-economy-sensex-at-130000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">[3]<\/a>, driven by rising income, consumption and digitization\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.morganstanley.com\/ideas\/digital-india\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">[4]<\/a>, and it is expected to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Indian consumers expect products to be delivered at their doorsteps for free, which causes a unique burden on the e-commerce companies not seen in most parts of the world.<\/li><\/ul><p>When a product from an e-commerce site is ordered online, the merchandize is picked up from a seller or a warehouse and brought to a processing, where it is sorted for the destination city- a process known as the \u201cfirst mile operation\u201d. It is then transported between origin and destination cities in a \u201cline haul\u201d that involves long-distance transportation such as truck, air etc. In the \u201clast mile operation\u201d, the merchandize goes to the delivery center from where it is delivered to the shopper\u2019s house.

In India, the same cost is ~30% of the total cost of delivery; notwithstanding India\u2019s low cost of labor. The extra cost comes from the longer time that a driver takes in locating an address- to drive to an address, stopping multiple times to either call the recipient or ask someone on the road or nearby shops for location and directions, time wasted on additional kilometers driven in search of the address etc.<\/p><p>Figure 4. Illustrates the challenges of delivering to addresses that cannot be disambiguated at the house level. In absence of a lat-long for the desired address, addresses are sorted based on pin codes and all the packages for one pincode are sorted, stored and delivered from one (or, sometimes, two or more) delivery center(s). Typical pincode-based sorting centers, located at the orange pin location can have a delivery \u201cthrow\u201d (radius) of 4-20 km. In absence of understanding load distribution based on addresses, such centers\u2019 locations often tend to be imbalanced. For example, in this case, while one delivery biker drives about 22 km, the other drives about 104 km, almost 5 times the distance covered by the first one. Such problems significantly hamper the initiatives to improve productivity and reduce costs at these centers.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-2a7efed elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"2a7efed\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.delhivery.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/image6.png\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-82a5b7b elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"82a5b7b\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Figure 4: The difference between a pincode-based sorting and local-address-based sorting.

In such cases, the \u201cthrow\u201d of the delivery center goes down to an average of 1-3 km. The bikers typically cover small distances in a shift and multiple shifts can be run in a day to match the schedule of multiple trucks that can bring loads throughout the day from the destination hubs. In Figure 4, the locations for such small delivery centers are represented by red pins and areas they cover are shown in yellow.

McKinsey estimates that the payoff for digital financial services in India by 2025 can be $700 billion and it can create an additional 21 million jobs.<\/p>\n<p>The reasons for the paucity of credit are many: lack of verifiable identity (akin to social security number in the USA), absence of proof of formal income in a largely cash-driven economy and complexity of disambiguating one\u2019s location, be it home, or place of business.<\/p>\n<p>This has started to change in the past few years.

To understand why, consider the following addresses for the same house, in Figure 6.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-3e6a594 elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"3e6a594\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"800\" height=\"331\" src=\"https:\/\/www.delhivery.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/image4.png\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-f792a36 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"f792a36\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Figure 6: Same address written in multiple formats in different documents<\/strong><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-2c0db0d elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"2c0db0d\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Consider the different variations:<\/p><ul dir=\"ltr\"><li>The house number has been written in\u00a0<strong>three<\/strong>\u00a0formats. \u201cTH-146B\u201d, \u201c146\u201d, as well as \u201cUnit 146\u201d<\/li><li>The community has been described as both \u201cPurva Parkridge\u201d and \u201cPurva Park Ridge\u201d, and has been abbreviated as \u201cPPR\u201d again, in\u00a0<strong>three<\/strong>\u00a0different ways<\/li><li>The road name has been spelled in two ways as \u201cGoshala Road\u201d and \u201cGhosala Road\u201d and omitted in one all-together<\/li><li>The locality is described as \u201cGaruda Char Palya\u201d and \u201cGaruda Charpalya\u201d.

Rather than just being a convenience, addresses are vital for driving a self-reinforcing economic cycles and therefore, improving livelihood and incomes for the next billion Indians. The consumers independently identify and adopt addresses for their own convenience while the businesses use technology or third-party services to resolve these addresses into geocodes to deliver products and services at reduced costs. However, the current addressing system in India does not lend itself to disambiguation to a reasonably accurate lat-long for most addresses.<\/p><p>Our case-study analyses indicate that the lack of a good addressing system costs India at least $10-14B a year, or about 0.5% of its annual Gross Domestic Product. As the Indian economy continues to grow in both economic output as well as variety of \u00a0new businesses and services, the costs due to lack of a proper addressing system will increase significantly. India therefore needs to consider a dramatically new approach to modernize the addressing system to bring in efficiency.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-57524e2 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"57524e2\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">ABOUT THE AUTHORS:<\/h2>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-27b8c24 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"27b8c24\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Dr. Santanu Bhattacharya<\/strong>\u00a0is scientist collaborating with Camera Culture Group at MIT Media Lab.
