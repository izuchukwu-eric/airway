Coverage:<\/b>\u00a0If the business needs to supply products all over the country, then choose a shipping partner that has a presence in either the whole country or in maximum areas of one particular region with tie-ups with smaller logistics service providers for the last mile delivery in areas with no presence.<\/p><p><b>2. Cost:<\/b>\u00a0The cost incurred to deliver a product by a company from its production facility to the end-user destination depends on two factors: package weight and distance covered. A business should select a shipping company that can handle packages across weight categories and deliver them to the end-user at reasonable rates.<\/p><p><b>3. Trust:\u00a0<\/b>A business needs to select a shipping partner with several years of experience in delivering products to the end-user and has gained their trust as a reliable service provider. This trust is bolstered by the fact how a\u00a0<a class=\"link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.delhivery.com\/\">shipping and logistics company\u00a0<\/a>packages the products to ensure they are not stolen, misplaced, broken, or contaminated.<\/p><p><b>4. Support:<\/b>\u00a0A business should select a shipping partner based on the fact as to how it supports its operations, by giving clarity to end-users about the delivery status, trace shipment, provide answers and solutions for their query through phone or email, or app or website or social media platform.<\/p><p><b>5. Flexibility:<\/b>\u00a0An SME business can choose a shipping partner based on its ability to provide flexible services. How the company manages uncertain occurrences that might delay the delivery of products to the end-user, handling unforeseen events like strikes, curfew, floods, or accidents, and whether they have other options to ensure the end-use customer is not kept waiting can be a deciding factor. Delhivery has remained operational through the pandemic and was among the first to kick start its network across 15,000+ pin codes within 5 days of the 1st Junta Curfew\u00a0in March\u00a02020, a true display of its network&#8217;s resilience.<\/p><p><b>6. Up to date:<\/b>\u00a0A business needs to select a shipping partner based on its ability to stay up to date with the latest technological advances. Delhivery\u2019s ability to use technology to quicken delivery schedule, material handling, and dispatch, invoicing, and other things and train the last mile delivery man in the use of technology makes it an ideal choice. Network update information is shared daily with all clients of Delhivery for complete transparency.<\/p><p><b>7. Problem solving:<\/b>\u00a0A business must select a shipping partner based on its ability to follow through on its delivery to ensure the product is safely delivered to the end-user. In case it is not delivered for whatever reason, what are the contingencies that the shipping and logistic company follow to solve such problems? A consistency in follow-up approach like what is followed by Delhivery may well decide whether a logistics and shipping company can become a shipping partner of an SME business.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-bff2278 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"bff2278\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">CONCLUSION<\/h2>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-2d08d62 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"2d08d62\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"ourBlogContent\"><p>For selecting a technology-driven shipping and logistic company like Delhivery as a shipping partner, SME businesses must prioritize the requirements for each product and evaluate the time taken for delivery by the logistics services provider. Also, businesses must figure out how well the shipping partner adapts to technology changes, responds to a query from the end-user, and what the resolution time is. In emergency scenarios like COVID-19, what protocols are being followed by the shipping partners is also an important factor.<\/p><\/div>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>THE WHY &#038; THE WHO The key to any business whether big or small consistently growing in terms of profits depends on how well it can churn out finished products on time, and ensure that it is delivered to the end-user\/customer on time by a shipping and logistic company.
