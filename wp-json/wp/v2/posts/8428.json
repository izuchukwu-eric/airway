However, given that we already have substantial cash on our balance sheet, we expect it to be a primary issue in the $400-500 million range,\u201d he said. \u201c Since we are an Indian company and have a substantial part of our business here, we will list locally.\u201d<\/p><p>This is the first time the management of Delhivery has specified a definite time frame for its IPO.<\/p><p>The logistics tech company has constituted a board sub-committee for its IPO and mergers and acquisitions in January. \u201cWe are going into a public listing sitting on $550 million in cash and we don\u2019t burn money,\u201d said Barua, formerly a consultant at Bain.<\/p><p>He teamed up with Kapil Bharti, Suraj Saharan, Mohit Tandon and Bhavesh Manglani to set up Delhivery in 2011.
