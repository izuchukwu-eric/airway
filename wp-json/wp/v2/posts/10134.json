Experts estimate that the\u00a0<a class=\"link\" href=\"https:\/\/inc42.com\/datalab\/inside-india-d2c-rush-a-100bn-market-opportunity-by-2025\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">D2C market opportunity<\/a>\u00a0will grow to $100 billion in the next four years! D2C brands are growing not just in traditionally consumer-driven spaces like fashion or electronics, but also across niche products such as premium coffee, craft beer, custom tailoring etc.<\/p><p>One of the primary drivers of D2C growth is its proximity to the customer. From the awareness stage, when the customer first lands on your website or downloads the app, all the way to checkout, D2C brands can track the user journey intricately. They can collect data about where the customer is coming from, what products they\u2019re looking for, what related products are they interested in, how soon they make decisions etc. D2C brands, then, use this visibility to improve user experience on their digital channels.<\/p><p>However, the biggest challenge D2C brands face today is that their visibility ends the moment the customer completes the purchase.<\/p><p>The entire logistics and fulfilment process that happens post-purchase remains in the dark. This means that D2C brands are optimising their business operations based on partial information.<\/p><p>In this blog post, we discuss how logistics analytics can complete the picture for D2C brands. We explore how Delhivery leverages data from the logistics processes offer more comprehensive ways to improve operations.<\/p><\/div>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-6bc7546 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"6bc7546\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">OPTIMISE FULFILMENT WITH DELHIVERY\u2019S LOGISTICS DASHBOARD<\/h2>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-a83ff8d elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"a83ff8d\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>For D2C brands, fulfilment is a significant cost centre. The money spent in packaging, shipping, delivery and returns management add up over time. As you scale, logistics expenses can grow disproportionately. More often than not, even if you\u2019re using the cheapest parcel delivery, various peripheral factors can bloat your logistics expenses. Especially if you\u2019re tracking your packages manually, through spreadsheets, it will be too late before you even realise that your expenses are going out of hand.<\/p><p>The best way to prevent this is to have complete and granular visibility into your operations.<\/p><p>Our fulfilment centres are managed by our own proprietary solution, collecting data about every step in the process. You can use this information to batch related orders, club similar orders etc. to optimise costs.<\/p><p>Our warehouse management solution offers clear, real-time visibility into your inventory position. You can use this visibility to track your inventory in real-time and even re-route returned products directly to the next destination, instead of your central warehouse.<\/p><p>Moreover, the Delhivery customer dashboard offers clear visibility into your logistics expenses. It shows you in real-time how much you\u2019re spending in packaging, shipping, express shipping,speed parcel service,\u00a0air courier service, same day\/next day delivery, last-mile delivery, warehousing, returns shipping etc. across customer types, geographies and more. Using the dashboard, you can keep an eye on your logistics expenses in real-time, cutting costs and improving efficiencies as you go along.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-f14d2fe elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"f14d2fe\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">UNDERSTAND YOUR CUSTOMERS BEYOND THEIR DIGITAL TRAIL<\/h2>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-9e3239f elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"9e3239f\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou might have the world\u2019s best D2C e-commerce website. But if your fulfilment processes are inefficient, the overall customer experience will be less than ideal. So, for up-and-coming D2C brands, it is important that a great user experience stretches beyond your website, right until the delivery of the product at the customer\u2019s doorstep. However, if you use a courier express partner for deliveries, you have no way to know if your customers are happy with your fulfilment until a disgruntled customer complains on Twitter!\n\nAs an e-commerce fulfilment company, Delhivery spends a lot of energy solving this problem. With Delhivery\u2019s dashboard, you will have a clear view of customer preferences:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Are they willing to pay extra for express delivery?<\/li>\n \t<li>Do they prefer\u00a0<a class=\"link\" href=\"\/setup-business-blogs\/accept-cash-on-delivery-confidently-with-delhivery-smes\/\">cash-on-delivery<\/a>\u00a0(COD) over prepay?<\/li>\n \t<li>Do prepay customers or COD customers return more products?<\/li>\n \t<li>Who orders multiple sizes\/variants of the same product and return the ones that don\u2019t fit?<\/li>\n \t<li>Are there preferences for certain products over various locations?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nYou can find answers to such questions from the logistics data Delhivery offers you and optimise your operations accordingly. For instance, if more of your customers prefer COD, you might want to incentivise prepay. If there is demand for 1-2 of your products in a specific location, you might set up a small warehouse nearby to stock goods there for quicker delivery. If a specific product is being returned more than others, you can send it back for a quality check.\n\nOn the other hand, you can integrate Delhivery\u2019s services with your existing order management systems to gain a complete view of customer behaviour. For instance, you can identify specific cohorts of high-value customers and offer loyalty programs. You can use our return-to-origin (RTO) predictors to know in advance which of your orders are likely to be returned. You can use this information to take preventative action such as converting COD orders to prepay, adjusting your returns policy etc.\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-e3e525b elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"e3e525b\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">IMPROVE D2C BUSINESS OUTCOMES WITH DELHIVERY<\/h2>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-ce93f33 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"ce93f33\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"ourBlogContent\"><p>Traditional brands see order fulfilment as an afterthought \u2014 something that has little or no impact on the customer experience.

The experience that the customer feels while receiving and opening their order can be the difference between a bad Google review or a lifelong loyal customer.<\/p><p>Creating stellar customer experiences for D2C brands depends almost entirely on the logistics partners. We, at Delhivery, make it our mission is to deliver stellar customer experiences for you. With Delhivery, you can take customer data to do a lot more than just optimise their online experience.
