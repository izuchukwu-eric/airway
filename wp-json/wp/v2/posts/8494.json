In this situation, one of the sectors to come forward in times of need was the logistics and supply chain industry.<\/p><p>And leading from the front is Delhivery, which may soon get listed publicly. In an interview with Business Insider, Delhivery\u2019s chief technology officer (CTO) and co-founder Kapil Bharati shared how the company leveraged technology to make sense of the disruption in logistics and also cut down on costs at the same time.<\/p><\/div>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-ea1c5af elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"ea1c5af\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">LOCKDOWN LOGISTICS<\/h3>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-b47d79a elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"b47d79a\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cWe started a bit early, in the beginning of March 2020, and started putting in various interventions in place for COVID-19. So by the time the lockdown actually happened, we had systems in place and the operational processes in place,\u201d said Bharati.<\/p><p>Just two-three days after the lockdown was announced in March last year, Delhivery was up and running in 4,500 pincodes and after 10 days, they were operational in 15,000 pincodes in India.<\/p><p>They also used technology to quickly differentiate between essential and non-essential products to ensure seamless delivery. Kshitij Chopra, co-head, products and strategy at Delhivery explained how they went about it.<\/p><p>&#8220;We modified the algorithms to identify the government regulations on what classifies as essential and what is non essential. That not only helped us move shipments or deliveries in the network, but also helped our business development teams to proactively reach out to clients who were shipping the same categories of goods saying \u2018hey, you can actually continue shipping,\u2019 because there was so much confusion on ground,\u201d he said.<\/p><p>The second problem was identifying where they can ship, since the containment zones didn\u2019t allow deliveries. \u201cWe had people on ground, where we were able to quickly coordinate with local authorities. As and when the definition of essential was changing, we were also upgrading our backend systems,\u201d said Bharati.<\/p><p>And also, this is helping the SoftBank-backed logistics unicorn, which has been cutting down on its losses even before the pandemic. As per reports, in FY20, Delhivery\u2019s net loss stood at \u20b9284.13 crore from \u20b91,781.04 crore reported in FY19.<\/p><p>They also doubled down on fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) and pharmaceutical clients. It was only after two-three months that the demand from e-commerce portals doubled. \u201cAfter 10 months, we saw the volumes coming back to pre-COVID levels, and pretty much the entire network was up and running,\u201d said Bharati.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-b970184 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"b970184\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">USING DATA FOR DELIVERY<\/h3>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-934c16b elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"934c16b\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>For Delhivery, the physical infrastructure is just one part of the operations \u2013 innovating on their technology and data science capabilities is another. \u201cWe use a bunch of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) optimisation tools to answer questions like the best route, time etc., for delivery. This helps us get to a higher quality of service at a lower cost,\u201d said Chopra.<\/p><p>Delhivery also has a proprietary system, which does geocoding and helps connect last mile riders with end consignees in an efficient way. \u201cLocation intelligence is one big area for us, where we continue to develop our capabilities and keep on integrating it back into our system so we can drive more and more automation and system direction. The second is customer intelligence and the third aspect is product intelligence,\u201d said Bharati.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-671a9a3 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"671a9a3\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">HIRING AND TECH EXPANSIONS<\/h3>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-db11e9a elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"db11e9a\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"news-content news-content-2\"><p>Delhivery&#8217;s focus remains in expanding its tech capabilities.
