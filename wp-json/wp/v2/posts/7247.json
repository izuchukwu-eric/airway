The huge demand for home delivery, coupled with a shortage of truck drivers in this pandemic, has added to the operational costs of shipping.<\/p><p>You have multiple factors that come into play determining your operational costs. This includes total weight, size, volume, how far it has to be transported, mode of transit, etc. Optimising these factors can help reduce the operational costs of your shipping business.<\/p><p>Even though most e-commerce logistics companies allocate sufficient budget to shipping operations, they still end up overshooting it most of the time. This is predominantly due to a lack of knowledge about best practices.<\/p><p>In this post, we have compiled a list of 8 best practices or ideas that you can incorporate to reduce the operational cost of your shipping business.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-6bc7546 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"6bc7546\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">1.

As a thumb rule, try not to cover the extra miles, that is, addresses too far away from the warehouse at the initial stage of your business. Though it might prevent you from expanding your target audience, you can use the time and cost you saved to deliver the products to existing customers quicker, thereby increasing customer satisfaction. You can even charge more if you deliver quicker. For example, a study shows that 41% of customers are willing to pay more for same-day delivery. One way to reduce costs due to distance and offer same\/next day delivery is to store closer to the customer across regionally distributed warehouses across the country. Delhivery operates warehouses across all major cities and demand pockets in India for you to store locally and deliver faster for less.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-5cfeeab elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"5cfeeab\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">2.
