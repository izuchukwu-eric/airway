However, very few of us think of the neighbourhood kirana store, the lady who sells cute baby socks from her house, or the roadside furniturewala as a flourishing business. When, in fact, it is small businesses like these that form the backbone of the Indian economy, especially in the hinterlands.<\/p><p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.livemint.com\/news\/india\/msmes-the-growth-engines-of-the-indian-economy-11597923225239.html\" target=\"blank\">Micro, small and medium enterprises<\/a>\u00a0(MSMEs) contribute 30% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) and 40% of the exports. They employ 110 million people across the country, with more than half of the MSMEs operating from rural India.<\/p><p>Yet, until very recently, the market of any MSME was local, often hyperlocal. For example, a jewellery designer would handcraft designs and sell to his\/her local customers through their storefront or stall at a crafts exhibition. A slightly larger business operation might distribute to specific stores in various cities and towns, who will then sell these products on their storefronts. And most of the exports were also bulk sales to another distributor abroad.<\/p><p>So, until recently, the reach and, therefore the markets of SMEs were limited to where their products can physically be displayed.<\/p><p>The internet changed all that. It ushered in an era of D2C \u2014 Direct to Consumer \u2014 a business where anyone can sell any product to a customer anywhere in the world. Today, every small business owner can have multiple storefronts all online!<\/p><ul><li><b>Website<\/b>\u00a0where you can showcase all your products in any way you want<\/li><li><b>Instagram store<\/b>\u00a0where you can engage, cross-sell and upsell customers<\/li><li><b>Facebook store<\/b>\u00a0where people can buy but also talk about it and share it with their friends<\/li><li><b>WhatsApp<\/b>\u00a0where you can communicate in real-time with your customers, understand their needs and sell your products<\/li><li><b>YouTube demos<\/b>\u00a0where you show off your product via video \u2014 like the home-shopping network on TV \u2014 and invite customers to buy with a click of a button<\/li><\/ul><p>The internet has thrown open a world of opportunities for small. The pandemic has accelerated this. Now, shoppers are more attuned to buying online. They are comfortable with evaluating and shortlisting even personal products such as jewellery and clothing through online modes. They are willing to pay in advance for priority delivery.<\/p><p>However, being able to sell a product online easily does not always mean it will be easy to fulfil that order. Packaging, shipping and delivery of an online order requires a strong supply chain and logistics management system. It is here that most small businesses struggle. From our experience working with some of the country\u2019s fastest-growing SMEs, we\u2019ve identified the top features that good fulfilment services need to have.<\/p><\/div>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-6bc7546 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"6bc7546\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">#1 NATION-WIDE REACH\n<\/h2>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-a83ff8d elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"a83ff8d\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>It\u2019s important that your shipping and logistics company can deliver across locations throughout the country.
