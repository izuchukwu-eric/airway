Even then, cash on delivery accounted for 28% of e-commerce orders!<\/p><p>Despite the growth in digital payments and increased fintech maturity, cash on delivery is here to stay. This is for one simple reason: Customers in India still like to see, touch and feel the product before paying for it. As a small and medium enterprise (SME) without a strong track record, you will be losing out on a huge opportunity if you don\u2019t offer cash on delivery. Here\u2019s why.<\/p><p>1. Fewer customers will give you a chance if they can\u2019t pay cash on delivery. They are more likely to choose a brand they already know \u2014 either through advertisements or past purchase \u2014 instead of risking an advance payment online with you.<\/p><p>2. When cash on delivery is not an option, customers may not trust you. They might wonder if you\u2019re not confident of the product quality. They might also worry if the returns processes might be difficult if they pay you in advance.<\/p><p>3. You will miss out on a large part of the Indian economy that is not comfortable with online payments, do not own credit cards etc.<\/p><p>If you\u2019re selling online today, you need to offer cash on delivery services to establish yourself, grow and scale your business.<\/p><p>But for small and medium enterprises, this is not easy. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a small business building products from your garage. You most likely use a courier service to ship your products. Courier companies today are not equipped to accept cash or transfer them to you \u2014 they can only deliver products from one place to another. In this case, the only way to offer cash on delivery is to do the logistics yourself. That is not only expensive, but also inefficient.<\/p><p>We understand this, and we\u2019ve designed Delhivery SME to address exactly this problem.
