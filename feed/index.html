What comes to mind when we say, “packaged foods”? If you’re thinking of potato chips, instant noodles and puliogare mixes, you’re probably not familiar with the gourmet revolution that is underway. In May last year, Conde Nast Traveller, a leading food and lifestyle magazine, made a listicle of <a class="link" href="https://www.cntraveller.in/story/made-in-india-25-indian-food-brands-local-vocal-pm-modi-chocolate-cheese-coffee-honey-beverage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;25 Indian food brands </a>that are world-class”. It includes companies that make chocolate, cheese, coffee, Kombucha and more!

This list is only the beginning. Manufacturing and selling canned foods like jams and pasta sauce, packaged products like cookies and biscuits, sports supplements, nutrition products, sweets, chocolates, even pet supplies, several small boutique brands are emerging all over the country. Their key differentiators are:

<b>Premium products:</b> Even everyday goods like papads or pasta sauce are hand-made with high-quality ingredients focusing on health and taste.

<b>Enthusiastic customers:</b> The buyers of these packaged food items are enthusiasts or connoisseurs willing to pay a premium for organic, high-quality, customised products.

<b>Direct to consumer model:</b> Unlike mass-market brands, premium packaged foods brands sell directly to consumers, often on a recurring subscription basis.

SMEs are spearheading this revolution. They are competing against global conglomerates who already have extensive manufacturing capabilities, distribution and promotional budgets.

To be truly successful in this market, SMEs need to deliver exceptional customer experience.

The first step in this process is a delicious product, which you already have. As the next step, you need to ensure a stellar customer experience at every touchpoint in the customer journey: From the moment they hear about you, all the way to <a class="link" href="/services/supply-chain-services/">supply chain and logistics,</a> last-mile delivery, returns and refunds too.

At Delhivery, we strive to be the kind of logistics and supply chain management partner that enables a seamless customer experience for you. Delhivery SME, our small business-focussed e-commerce logistics solution, is designed to deliver precisely that. To make your customer experience is exceptional, we promise three things:
<ul>
 	<li>Speed of delivery</li>
 	<li>Safety and structural integrity of the package</li>

</ul>

							When you launch your business online, you’ll attract new customers who might not know or use your products. They might be willing to give you a chance, but only if you can make it risk-free for them. For instance, if you’re a fashion designer selling high-quality hand-made dresses, you will likely charge a premium. However, the customer might be sceptical about paying that price without seeing/touching the fabric. <a class="link" href="/setup-business-blogs/accept-cash-on-delivery-confidently-with-delhivery-smes/ ">Cash-on-delivery service </a>can help overcome that scepticism, allowing them to experience the product and then pay for it.						</div>

Experts estimate that the <a class="link" href="https://inc42.com/datalab/inside-india-d2c-rush-a-100bn-market-opportunity-by-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D2C market opportunity</a> will grow to $100 billion in the next four years! D2C brands are growing not just in traditionally consumer-driven spaces like fashion or electronics, but also across niche products such as premium coffee, craft beer, custom tailoring etc.</p><p>One of the primary drivers of D2C growth is its proximity to the customer. From the awareness stage, when the customer first lands on your website or downloads the app, all the way to checkout, D2C brands can track the user journey intricately. They can collect data about where the customer is coming from, what products they’re looking for, what related products are they interested in, how soon they make decisions etc. D2C brands, then, use this visibility to improve user experience on their digital channels.</p><p>However, the biggest challenge D2C brands face today is that their visibility ends the moment the customer completes the purchase.</p><p>The entire logistics and fulfilment process that happens post-purchase remains in the dark. This means that D2C brands are optimising their business operations based on partial information.</p><p>In this blog post, we discuss how logistics analytics can complete the picture for D2C brands. We explore how Delhivery leverages data from the logistics processes offer more comprehensive ways to improve operations.</p></div>						</div>

				<div class="elementor-widget-container">
							<p>For D2C brands, fulfilment is a significant cost centre. The money spent in packaging, shipping, delivery and returns management add up over time. As you scale, logistics expenses can grow disproportionately. More often than not, even if you’re using the cheapest parcel delivery, various peripheral factors can bloat your logistics expenses. Especially if you’re tracking your packages manually, through spreadsheets, it will be too late before you even realise that your expenses are going out of hand.</p><p>The best way to prevent this is to have complete and granular visibility into your operations.</p><p>Our fulfilment centres are managed by our own proprietary solution, collecting data about every step in the process. You can use this information to batch related orders, club similar orders etc. to optimise costs.</p><p>Our warehouse management solution offers clear, real-time visibility into your inventory position. You can use this visibility to track your inventory in real-time and even re-route returned products directly to the next destination, instead of your central warehouse.</p><p>Moreover, the Delhivery customer dashboard offers clear visibility into your logistics expenses. It shows you in real-time how much you’re spending in packaging, shipping, express shipping,speed parcel service, air courier service, same day/next day delivery, last-mile delivery, warehousing, returns shipping etc. across customer types, geographies and more. Using the dashboard, you can keep an eye on your logistics expenses in real-time, cutting costs and improving efficiencies as you go along.</p>						</div>

				<div class="elementor-widget-container">
							You might have the world’s best D2C e-commerce website. But if your fulfilment processes are inefficient, the overall customer experience will be less than ideal. So, for up-and-coming D2C brands, it is important that a great user experience stretches beyond your website, right until the delivery of the product at the customer’s doorstep. However, if you use a courier express partner for deliveries, you have no way to know if your customers are happy with your fulfilment until a disgruntled customer complains on Twitter!

As an e-commerce fulfilment company, Delhivery spends a lot of energy solving this problem. With Delhivery’s dashboard, you will have a clear view of customer preferences:
<ul>
 	<li>Are they willing to pay extra for express delivery?</li>
 	<li>Do they prefer <a class="link" href="/setup-business-blogs/accept-cash-on-delivery-confidently-with-delhivery-smes/">cash-on-delivery</a> (COD) over prepay?</li>
 	<li>Do prepay customers or COD customers return more products?</li>
 	<li>Who orders multiple sizes/variants of the same product and return the ones that don’t fit?</li>
 	<li>Are there preferences for certain products over various locations?</li>
</ul>
You can find answers to such questions from the logistics data Delhivery offers you and optimise your operations accordingly. For instance, if more of your customers prefer COD, you might want to incentivise prepay. If there is demand for 1-2 of your products in a specific location, you might set up a small warehouse nearby to stock goods there for quicker delivery. If a specific product is being returned more than others, you can send it back for a quality check.

On the other hand, you can integrate Delhivery’s services with your existing order management systems to gain a complete view of customer behaviour. For instance, you can identify specific cohorts of high-value customers and offer loyalty programs. You can use our return-to-origin (RTO) predictors to know in advance which of your orders are likely to be returned. You can use this information to take preventative action such as converting COD orders to prepay, adjusting your returns policy etc.						</div>

This approach misses an important thing: Customer analytics.</p><p>Knowing who is buying, what they’re buying, where they’re located, what mode of payment they choose etc. can help identify the exact customer persona to target. Businesses can use this information to inform their marketing campaigns and personalise their advertising messages.</p><p>For instance, if your gourmet coffee brand is more popular in Bangalore and Delhi, than rest of the country, you can target your Facebook campaigns towards these locations as well as young IT/start-up professionals. This increases the conversion rates, naturally reducing acquisition costs.</p><p>By extension, you can also offer products that your customers are more likely to buy, based on their past purchases. You can customise your cross-sell/upsell offers; offer targeted subscription and loyalty programs — with free shipping, for instance — for customers to buy from you regularly.</p><p>Customer analytics from your logistics solution can give you complete visibility into your sales. It can:</p><ul><li>Save costs</li><li>Increase revenue</li><li>Improve the customer lifetime value</li></ul>						</div>

This means that you’ll have much fewer returns as a result of the inability to find the address or the customer not being available. In addition, intelligent analytics solutions like Return to Origin (RTO) predictors can help in reducing returns.</p><p>A good logistics solution can make your returns efficient in three ways:</p><ul><li>Reduce the possibility of returns in the first place</li><li>Minimise the cost of returns with strong reverse logistics</li><li>Increase sales by bringing the returned product back to you as quickly as possible</li></ul></div>						</div>

In the last century, globalisation opened trade borders and allowed large Indian corporations to expand their operations across the world. Today, the advent of Internet and e-commerce has offered that opportunity for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as well. In fact, the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) segment are<a class="link" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/in-2-years-time-msmes-will-contribute-60-to-indias-exports-nitin-gadkari/articleshow/76783949.cms?from=mdr" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> expected</a> to contribute over 60% of India’s exports by 2022.

Just because something is possible does not mean it’s easy. While large corporations have their own fleet,fulfilment services and centres, SMEs have to rely on logistics partners to get their products across borders. This leaves most of the operations out of their control and prone to challenges.

<b>For starters, they need to coordinate with multiple vendors </b>— one each for warehousing, shipping, transportation, customs, last-mile delivery etc. This makes the process a lot more complex, from unnecessary paperwork to difficult returns processing. And equally frustrating. A small business owner will not have the time or energy to resolve issues across multiple parties in various time zones through phone and email.

<b>Customs can be intimidating. </b>Small business owners are hardly savvy about the international shipping processes, customs guidelines, local clearance rules etc. As a result, they end up with products stuck in customs, delayed delivery, and customers themselves having to sort out issues. Worst case, they could fall into legal troubles and have their products banned from several countries.

<b>Shipping expenses can overshoot the value of the product itself.</b> This ends up being a lose-lose relationship for the SME and the customer. For instance, if shipping charges are separate, the customer might not be willing to bear the expense. If the SME has to bear it, it might result in losses.

While working with SMEs, we learned that they are reluctant to sell to customers abroad, considering these challenges. They miss out on the humongous opportunities that exports present merely for lack of a reliable logistics partner. To help such SMEs, we built Delhivery SME.

							<p>Most small businesses begin by hand-delivering packages locally. When online business comes from other cities, they typically use a regular courier company to send packages. However, this can’t scale. As the number of orders grow, you need a fulfilment partner who can do end-to-end shipping, taking care of all processes from your doorstep to your customer’s.</p><p>While choosing a fulfilment partner, here are the qualities you must look for:</p><p>Do they offer pickup services, or do you need to go to their location to drop your products off? You can save a lot of time and money by finding a partner who can pick up products.</p><p>Do they cover the entire country? You need a single partner who can handle all your orders instead of having a dozen courier partners for each region. So, country-wide reach is important.</p><p>Can they handle packaging too? As you scale, you need the option to outsource your packaging for efficiency.</p><p>Do they have a wide network of fulfilment centres? A service that ensures last-mile delivery can help you have better control over your customer experience.</p><p>Do they have a solid warehouse management system A digital and real-time management solution can make it easy to monitor and track your products in transit.</p><p>Do they offer no-contact delivery? Customers are looking for services they can trust. So, you need a delivery partner who cares for your safety as well as your customers.</p><p>Do they support cash on delivery? This is critical if you wish you acquire more customers for your brand.</p><p>Do they have a hassle-free returns management system in place? Returns play an important role in building trust in e-commerce. The easier you make it, the more reliable customers will see you as.</p>						</div>

<p>&#8220;I joined the Small Business vertical in Dec 2018 with the goal to improve the client experience and performance for the small and medium businesses at Delhivery. Having worked in both MNCs as well as Start-ups earlier, Delhivery has been a refreshing change with a good mix of both worlds as one gets the freedom to take on new challenges and think out of the box for solutions while also having processes to guide you and a very accessible leadership to support you. Over the last few months, the Small Business vertical has managed to take bigger strides with new processes and product automation to make the end to end process for a client from onboarding to shipping more seamless and efficient.&#8221;</p>

In some cases, the courier company will not have the processes needed to prevent theft or manipulation during transit.</p><p>Delhivery’s network of courier partners is thoroughly vetted and trained to avoid such circumstances. We hold them to high accountability processes to prevent fraud, theft or damage in transit.

With this, SMEs can mitigate the risks of fraud in two ways:</p><ul><li>They can identify scammers who have an unreasonably high rate of returns. They can either avoid shipping to such customers or take necessary.</li><li>They can understand legitimate customers who want to try things but are not satisfied with the product. To help these customers, SMEs can pre-emptively address issues, offer more information upfront etc.</li></ul></div>						</div>

							<p>&#8220;I have always had a strong entrepreneurial streak, and the process of building something from scratch has always excited me. I joined Delhivery in 2012 as one of the first team members. At Delhivery, I have built our first fulfilment center, scaled our entire partner program for alternate delivery and distribution, and now run the entire cross-border business vertical. Dealing with ambiguity daily and refining the problem statement to provide a clearer vision for my team is the biggest challenge. This is what keeps me going as we carve out our success story.&#8221;</p>						</div>
